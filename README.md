Vagrant  Files for Several uses
===============================

All these Vagrantfile are separated in directory.
Some are provisionned with Ansible. In this case the root directory should be as the same level as the [ansible-playbooks](https://github.com/drkms/ansible-playbooks) repository in order to work

All of this are VirtualBoxes. The Vagrant obviously needs VirtualBox, but also some plugin, especially for the guest addition. You can install [this plugin](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest) :
``` vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest ```
